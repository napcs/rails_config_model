# ==Setup and overview
# Generate a new configuration system for your application by executing the generator from the root of your application.
# 
#   ruby script\generate configuration
#   
# Once installed, you modify the generated migration to include the fields you want to configure. There are a few defaults there to give you an idea.
# 
# The generator will create a controller mounted at /configuration so you can edit your configurations.  Modify this as needed to provide for security.
#  
# ===The Edit form
# The application's edit form uses the *form* helper method to auto-generate the fields. This may not be optimal and you may wish to actually write your own view instead. See app/views/configuration/edit.rhtml for more details.
# 
# ==Usage
# Configuration is simply a model for this table. It is designed to handle a single row of a table, and so additional rows cannot be created. 
# If you have a table that looks like this:
#    
#    id
#    contact_email
#    contact_name
#    
# You simply grab the row from the table
# 
#     @configuration = Configuration.load
#     
# and then grab the values out.
# 
#     email = @configuration.contact_email
# 
#
